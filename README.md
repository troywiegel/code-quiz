# Code Quiz

I created a JavaScript code quiz that:

* Cycles through an array of questions with answers that compares the user's input to the pre determined correct answer
* Stores these answers to local storage and grabs that data later to show the highest score the player has earned while playing
* The player is able to continously loop through the game and try to beat their highest score
